python is scripting language....

statically typed language 
    defining data type is mandatory
dynamic typed language
    defining data type is not mandatory

compiler 
    
interpreter

operators: operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
arithmetic operators +,-,*,/,%,//,** , // floor division, ** exponentiation
logical operators and, or, not
relational operators <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
asiignment operators =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,//=,**=
bitwise operators &,|,^,~,<<,>>
membership operators in, not in
identity operators is, is not


swaping no:
no1 = 10
no2 = 20


decsion making statements:
if else
loops

bloack {}


no % 2 ==0 and no >50
and

t    t   t
f    -   f
t    f   f

or

t  -   t
f  t   t
f  f   f

entry control loop

for   : startin point, ending point
while : when to stop we dont know


153 is an armstrong no

 3     3     3
1   + 5   + 3    = 153

1 + 125 + 27 = 153


DS --> list , tuple, dictonary, set ,Array 

array :-> array is a collection of similar data type elements
10 student marks store s1marks,s2marks,s3marks,s4marks,s5marks,s6marks,s7marks,s8marks,s9marks,s10marks'
1000,100000 ,
[index] index starts from 0
1 --> 0th index
nth index --> n-1
1000 --> 999 1000-1

list:
list is a collection of different data type elements
list is mutable --> we can change the data
list is ordered --> we can access the data using index
list allows duplicate elements
list allows hetrogenous data
list is represented by []
list is dynamic

#list comprehension

tuple:
tuple is a collection of different data type elements
tuple is immutable --> we cannot change the data
tuple is ordered --> we can access the data using index
tuple allows duplicate elements
tuple allows hetrogenous data
tuple is represented by ()
tuple is static --> we cannot change the size of tuple

aadhar card number -->
address --> list
name --> list
bank balance --> list

-->50 --> 10 --> 

index --->
col ->
sp -> 

key value pair --> dictonary
{key:value}
username:password

dict does have comprehsion

#set ---> set is a collection of unique elements hw

#function --->function is a block of code which is used to perform a specific task

type of function 
1. predefine function
2. user define function

4 types of function
1. no arg no return value
2. no arg with return value
3. with arg no return value
4. with arg with return value
